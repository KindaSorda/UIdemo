*****IDEAS & PLANNING*****


INTENDED THEMES:
 - TH1: Staying hopeful in the darkest of times
 - TH2: Learning to rely on others/community/family for hope and happiness
 - TH3: (???) Maybe life on Earth could be heaven
    - TH3.1: If you focus on family, community, happiness and helping others


You are running a train
 - What do trains do?
    - Deliver shit

Cities need to be maintained with resources
 - Each city produces one resource and slowly ticks down the rest
 - Cities have a "population" value which can be considered their "health"
 - When all three resources are above zero, population increases
 - The higher the population, the faster the rate of production of a cities production resource, and the faster the decline of the rest
 - If any of the resources reach 0, population will start to decline
 - The more resources at 0, the faster the rate of decline
 - When population reaches 0, the city is "dead."

What happens when cities die? How does it impact/affect the player? Why do they care?
 - (TH3.1) Crew members will have emotional reactions that adversally effect their relationship with the player, which effects there combat stats


There's also a story
 - Kaya wants to rescue her father, and must do so with the help of the crew of the Heartrunner

"Cooking" for engines

Engines consume Memory Shards
 - Memory shards are the accumalted, crystalized memories of a given place (all it's people and history)
 - When removed from the area they formed, the memories destabilize, becoming fragmented or even twisted and nightmarish.
 - The "cook" must attune with the crystal before feeding it to the engine.
 - When the cook places their hand on the crystal, the are flooded with the contained memories. They must sort through the corrupted memories by contextualizing them with their own. 



\/ \/ \/ UI DEMO RELEVANT \/ \/ \/

Characters have individual units, or "hearts" of stamina. Let's call them breaths. Each move they can execute consumes a certain number of breaths.
A characters turn continues until they are out of breaths or do not have enough to do anything.
At the end of their turn, a character regains breaths equal to their base number of breaths. 
Characters can regain breaths up to a cap higher than they're base.
i.e. A character with base  4 breaths ends their turn with two breaths remaining, and regains 4, so at the start of their next turn has 6
The puprose is to enable attacks that the player must save breaths between turns in order to execute.
Additional thoughts
 - Maybe a character must have a certain status condition in order to accumulate more breaths than their base. Lets call it "Drive"
 - Could there be an "Out of breath" debuff for ending turn on 0, or spending breaths into the negatives.
 - "Out of Breath" => Lose a turn, or lower speed until next turn.

Soul meter
 - Every breath spent by party members contributes to a shared soul meter. When fully charged, party members may spend the soul meter to preform their ultimate move.

End Turn/Party Display/Soul Meter UI implementation ideas
 - The end turn button has the turn order bar coming of the right and part status bars coming off the left
 - Expand the bar of the current turn party member
 - End turn button is also the soul meter
 - Every breath spent accumaltes alongside the end turn button. When turn is ended, all accumalted breaths move into the button/meter and fill it up.
 - At full charge the player instantly enters a selection mode that forces them to choose which party member will use their ultimate. This does not effect turn order.

Buffs/Debugss technical implementation
All buffs/debuffs have the same tag. All characters tick down all their buffs/debuffs by one at the end of each turn (assuming not permanent effect).
Stacked buffs/debuffs will still count as a single effect and will end completely when the turn count is up.
